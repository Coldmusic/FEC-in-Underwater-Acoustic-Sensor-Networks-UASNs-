UPDATES:

 4/92  The linear system solver (FACTOR/BACSUB) used by  SCOOTER was not initializing one of the variables to 0.  Causing sporadic NaN/Infinity problems when using IEEE arithmetic.  A similar problem occured  with the axis length specification for plots in FIELDS.

 9/92  The option of putting an acousto-elastic halfspace on the top was not working properly. (It took the density from the lower halfspace.)

10/92
FIELDS produced erroneous results when the number of wavenumber points exceeded the dimension limit of 10000.  A test has been added to flag this error and the dimension has been increased to 50000.

12/92
SPARC modified so that if the parameters are such that the time integration is fully explicit (ALPHA=BETA=0.0) then the linear solver is bypassed.  This gives some improvement in performance.

 1/93
FIELDS was writing an extra vector at zero range in cases where subsampling was required.  This caused PLOTSLICE to have problems plotting TL.

 2/93
Error in PLOTTS fixed.  The FLOW and FHIGH numbers were always used for bandpass filtering even when the option 'N' (no filtering) was selected.  If the  bandpass filter were wider than the signal bandwidth you effectively disabled filtering.  If, however,  you had a narrow bandpass filter then it was always applied to the signal and might have produced confusing results.

 3/93
Error in SOURCE fixed.  When the time-reversal option was used, SOURCE reversed the time coordinates as many times as there were sources.  As a result, the time series was reversed but the times associated with the data were not.

 6/93
Error in FIELDS fixed. Occasionally it would reference an array index that was one point beyond the last calculated value. This had no significant effect on the TL field but caused a floating point exception on machines that trap references to an undefined value.

Error in SCOOTER fixed. SCOOTER was extracting the density at the source incorrectly: it took a density at a nearby point. When the nearby point was outside the grid, an undefined density was returned.

12/93
FIELDS modified so that the specified ranges of receivers are not changed.

 3/95
The plot option in FIELDS has been removed to make SCOOTER structurally similar to KRAKEN. Similarly, the input file to fields should now be called fields.flp rather than fields.plp.

 6/95
In SPARC the option for producing a time-series on a horizontal array was not working properly. The array variable RTSTRR was being loaded instead of RTSRR.

 1/98
FIELDS automatically increases the minimum range, RMIN, to ensure that we don't try to calculate a field value right on the source. Previously RMIN was bumped to 1 m which caused problems for ultrasonic applications. Now it is bumped to RMAX / 100000. 

 7/98
FIELDS was missing the declaration of PC as a complex variable. This affected  field calculations only if the polynomial interpolation (rather than the default Pade) was used.

 7/98
A test has been added to SPARC so that it will abort if the user specifies a larger mesh than SPARC has been dimensioned for.

3/3/01
The Pade interpolation option (actually the default) has occasionally produced NaN's. Following the modification in Numerical Recipes, a small perturbation has been introduced to avoid the 'rare 0/0 condition'. The problem appears to have been eliminated.

5/01
I needed the top and bottom reflection coefficient options in SCOOTER. This had not been exercised in many years (if ever) and several problems showed up. Open statements for the files were missing and the section of code that does dynamic allocation for the top reflection coefficient was using the variables for the bottom reflection coefficient, so it failed if they were already in use. Finally the DOS script needed modifying.

6/01
Looks like the option for using a pre-calculated reflection coefficient in SCOOTER had fallen into disrepair (or was never originally tested). Fixes were made to make the read process consistent with the current format of the IRC file used for that.

12/03
Some clean up in the Hankel transform routine (HTS.f90). Also, the option to select dB vs. linear scale in FIELDS.f90 has been eliminated since FIELDS.f90 no longer plots anything directly. Checks have been added during the read-in stage for that first option line so that a user using an old input file will get a clear error message. Finally, FIELDS has been implemented in MATLAB (see at/Matlab/fields2.m). Since FIELDS appears to be a reserved word in MATLAB the script is currently fields.m. SCOOTER and SPARC used to fold each row of the Green's function matrix across records. This was done to 1) keep the record length below the 4094 maximum in old f77 compilers, and 2) to keep the memory storage down for that same matrix by buffering it to the output file as each record was filled. Since this is a nuisance; since the f95 does not appear to have a maximum record length; since real memory is cheap and virtual memory seems like it ought to be fairly efficient here, I've eliminated that. Finally, the format of the Green's function file (GRNFIL) has been made identical to that of a shade file (SHDFIL).

5/05
Variable 'IniFlag' had not been declared as type LOGICAL in fields.f90. The defaul INTEGER was fine, except for the G95 compiler, which detected use of an integer as a logical ... fixed. Also, the subroutine FTS.f90 (inside HTS.f90) had fallen into disrepair. This is used for the rarely-used line-source option in FIELDS.f90. fixed.

6/05
The main tridiagonal matrix in SCOOTER has been converted to double precision. Roundoff errors were causing some problems when the number of elements was made large. (The problem showed up using 5000 points over 100 m in a Pekeris waveguide with a 50 Hz source. Thus we were using over 1000 points per wavelength, which you'd probably not normally do. However, you should be able to do this without breaking things.)

5/06
Changes to FIELDS to bring it in line with the Matlab version.

1/08
The Pade interpolation routine is used in FIELDS to interpolate the Green's function kernel. I had found that it seemed to act up in some cases and made Polynomial interpolation the default. However, my logic for making that the default was off, so the Pade method was being used (caused a problem for at/tests/halfspace when the wavenumber sampling was reduced. The logic has been fixed.
